# Day 0: Data Types

# Objective

Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

# Task

Variables named firstinteger,firstdecimal, and firststring  are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the +  operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert  # second integer # to an integer (Number type), then sum it with  and print the result on a new line using console.log.

2. Convert  to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with firstdecimal  and print the result on a new line using console.log.

3. Print the concatenation of firststring and secondstring on a new line using console.log. Note that first string must be printed first.

# Input Format

Data Type	                  Parameter	                    Description
string		                  secondinteger                 The string representation of an integer you must sum with firstinteger .
string		                  seconddecimal                 The string representation of a floating-point number you must sum with firstdecimal .
string		                  secondstring                   A string of one or more space-separated words you must append to secondstring.  

# Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

1. On the first line, print the sum of firstinteger and the integer representation of secondinteger.

2. On the second line, print the sum of firstdecimal and the floating-point representation of seconddecimal.
3. On the third line, print firststring concatenated with secondstring. You must print firststring before secondstring.

When we sum the integers  and , we get the integer . 

When we sum the floating-point numbers  and , we get . When we concatenate HackerRank with is the best place to learn and practice coding!, we get HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!.
